Chapter 02
- Create a program that accepts a positional argument and produces usage documentation
- Create a new output string depending on the inputs to the program
- Run a test suite

Your program should be called chapter-2.py. It will accept a single 
positional argu- ment and will print the given argument inside 
the “Ahoy” bit, along with the word “a” or “an” depending on 
whether the argument starts with a consonant or a vowel.

That is, if given “narwhal,” it should do this:
$ ./chapter-2.py narwhal
Ahoy, Captain, a narwhal off the larboard bow!
And if given “octopus,”
$ ./chapter-2.py octopus
Ahoy, Captain, an octopus off the larboard bow!
