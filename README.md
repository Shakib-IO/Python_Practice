# Python Practice

Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.

That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.

**What is Python Used For?**

1. GENERAL WEB DEVELOPMENT / BUILDING WEB APPS
2. SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING + DATA SCIENCE
3. Data Science / MACHINE LEARNING.
