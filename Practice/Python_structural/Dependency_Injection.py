# What is Dependency Injection?
"""
In simpler terms, it's about providing objects with the things they need to function, rather than making them create those things themselves.

Here's a breakdown of the concept:
Dependency: An object relies on another object (or service) to perform its tasks. This "other object" is considered a dependency.
Injection: Instead of creating its dependencies internally, an object receives them from external code. This "external code" is often called an injector.
