# Design Patterns
1. **Creational Patterns**: Facilitate flexible object creation and code reuse.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Assembling objects and classes into larger structures while retaining their adaptability and efficiency.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Efficient interaction and allocation of responsibilities between objects, ensuring effective communication.

#### Creational Patterns
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
2. **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
5. **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, avoiding the overhead of creating objects from scratch.
